Exceptions to the base PMIx Standard are listed here for each OpenPMIx release. These exceptions
are not indicative of any intent to stray from the Standard, but instead represent the difference
between the pace of development of the library versus the normal Standard's process. Accordingly,
it is expected that the exceptions listed below will make their way into a future release of the
PMIx Standard and then be removed from the list of exceptions in some future OpenPMIx release.
