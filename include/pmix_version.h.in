 * numbers. Note that this differs from the Standard version
 * and ABI version numbers for the release as the capabilities
 * refer to internal behaviors - e.g., how the cmd line parser
 * is operating. So someone who uses the cmd line parser might
 * compensate for some difference that occurs during/between
 * a PMIx release series

/*****    DEPRECATED    *****/

/* there was an initial thought that we would generate some
 * uber-list of defined flags for capabilities across all PMIx
 * versions, and then indicate which ones were supported by
 * this particular version by OR'ing them together into
 * some more general value. This has proven unworkable as you
 * get into a giant game of bit-counting to create the definitions.
 * Instead, we only define flags that this specific version
 * supports - thus, the value of the individual flag is irrelevant
 * and no general value is required.
 *
 * Since we cannot go back and change already-released versions,
 * we leave this one legacy definition here so those earlier
 * versions can find it. They are restricted to supporting only
 * the earlier capabilities anyway, so it really doesn't matter
