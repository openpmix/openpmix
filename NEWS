===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PMIx since
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, PMIx typically maintains two separate version
series simultaneously - the current release and one that is locked
to only bug fixes.  Since these series are semi-independent of each
other, a single NEWS-worthy item might apply to different series. For
example, a bug might be fixed in the master, and then moved to
multiple release branches.

**** all deviations from the PMIx Standard. This primarily includes

   is done transparently
 - Support reproducible builds

3.0.1 -- 23 Aug 2018
----------------------
**** DEPRECATION WARNING: The pmix_info_array_t struct was
**** initially marked for deprecation in the v2.x series.
**** We failed to provide clear warning at that time. This
**** therefore serves as warning of intended removal of
**** pmix_info_array_t in the future v4 release series.
- Fixed memory corruption bug in event notification
  system due to uninitialized variable
- Add numeric version field to pmix_version.h
- Transfer all cached data to client dstore upon first connect
- Implement missing job control and sensor APIs


3.0.0 -- 6 July 2018
------------------------------------
**** NOTE: This release implements the complete PMIX v3.0 Standard
**** and therefore includes a number of new APIs and features. These
**** can be tracked by their RFC's on the community website:
**** https://pmix.org/pmix-standard.
- Added blocking forms of several existing APIs:
    - PMIx_Log
    - PMIx_Allocation_request
    - PMIx_Job_control
    - PMIx_Process_monitor
- Added support for getting/validating security credentials
    - PMIx_Get_credential, PMIx_Validate_credential
- Extended support for debuggers/tools
    - Added IO forwarding support allowing tools to request
      forwarding of output from specific application procs,
      and to forward their input to specified target procs
    - Extended tool attributes to support synchronization
      during startup of applications. This includes the
      ability to modify an application's environment
      (including support for LD_PRELOAD) and define an
      alternate fork/exec agent
    - Added ability for a tool to switch server connections
      so it can first connect to a system-level server to
      launch a starter program, and then reconnect to that
      starter for debugging purposes
- Extended network support to collect network inventory by
     either rolling it up from individual nodes or by direct
     query of fabric managers. Added an API by which the
     host can inject any rolled up inventory into the local
     PMIx server. Applications and/or the host RM can access
     the inventory via the PMIx_Query function.
- Added the ability for applications and/or tools to register
     files and directories for cleanup upon their termination
- Added support for inter-library coordination within a process
- Extended PMIx_Log support by adding plugin support for new
     channels, including local/remote syslog and email. Added
     attributes to query available channels and to tag and
     format output.
- Fix several memory and file descriptor leaks

2.0.0 -- 22 Jun 2017
----------------------
**** NOTE: This release implements the complete PMIX v2.0 Standard
**** and therefore includes a number of new APIs and features. These
**** can be tracked by their RFC's in the RFC repository at:
**** https://github.com/pmix/RFCs. A formal standards document will
**** be included in a later v2.x release. Some of the changes are
**** identified below.
- Added the Modular Component Architecture (MCA) plugin manager and
  converted a number of operations to plugins, thereby allowing easy
  customization and extension (including proprietary offerings)
- Added support for TCP sockets instead of Unix domain sockets for
  client-server communications
- Added support for on-the-fly Allocation requests, including requests
  for additional resources, extension of time for currently allocated
  resources, and return of identified allocated resources to the scheduler
  (RFC 0005 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0005.md)
- Tightened rules on the processing of PMIx_Get requests, including
  reservation of the "pmix" prefix for attribute keys and specifying
  behaviors associated with the PMIX_RANK_WILDCARD value
  (RFC 0009 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0009.md)
- Extended support for tool interactions with a PMIx server aimed at
  meeting the needs of debuggers and other tools. Includes support
  for rendezvousing with a system-level PMIx server for interacting
  with the system management stack (SMS) outside of an allocated
  session, and adds two new APIs:
  - PMIx_Query: request general information such as the process
    table for a specified job, and available SMS capabilities
  - PMIx_Log: log messages (e.g., application progress) to a
    system-hosted persistent store
  (RFC 0010 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0010.md)
- Added support for fabric/network interactions associated with
  "instant on" application startup
  (RFC 0012 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0012.md)
- Added an attribute to support getting the time remaining in an
  allocation via the PMIx_Query interface
  (RFC 0013 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0013.md)
- Added interfaces to support job control and monitoring requests,
  including heartbeat and file monitors to detect stalled applications.
  Job control interface supports standard signal-related operations
  (pause, kill, resume, etc.) as well as checkpoint/restart requests.
  The interface can also be used by an application to indicate it is
  willing to be pre-empted, with the host RM providing an event
  notification when the preemption is desired.
  (RFC 0015 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0015.md)
- Extended the event notification system to support notifications
  across threads in the same process, and the ability to direct
  ordering of notifications when registering event handlers.
  (RFC 0018 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0018.md)
- Expose the buffer manipulation functions via a new set of APIs
  to support heterogeneous data transfers within the host RM
  environment
  (RFC 0020 - https://github.com/pmix/RFCs/blob/master/RFC0020.md)
- Fix a number of race condition issues that arose at scale
- Enable PMIx servers to generate notifications to the host RM
  and to themselves
