[malformed net_private_ipv4]
PMIx has detected at least one malformed IP address or netmask in
the value of the opal_net_private_ipv4 MCA parameter.  The
opal_net_private_ipv4 MCA parameter accepts a semicolon-delimited list
of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation specifications, each
of the form <ipaddress>/<mask>.  For example:

     10.0.0.0/8;172.16.0.0/12;192.168.0.0/16;169.254.0.0/16

The first detected malformed entry was %s.
#
[invalid-net-mask]
PMIx has detected a malformed IPv4 address or netmask:

  Value provided: %s

Accepted values follow the Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) notation specifications. For example:

     10.0.0.0/8
     172.16/12
     192.168
     169.254.0.0/16
#
