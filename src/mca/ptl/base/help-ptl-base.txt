[include-exclude]
Both TCP interface include and exclude lists were specified:

  Include: %s
  Exclude: %s

Only one of these can be given.
#
[not-parseable]
The specified network is not parseable. Since we cannot determine
your desired intent, we cannot establish a TCP socket for PMIx
communications and will therefore abort. Please correct the network
specification and retry.
#
[invalid if_inexclude]
WARNING: An invalid value was given for pmix_ptl_base_if_%s.  This
value will be ignored.

  Local host: %s
  Value:      %s
  Message:    %s
#
[accept failed]
WARNING: The accept(3) system call failed on a TCP socket.  While this
should generally never happen on a well-configured HPC system, the
most common causes when it does occur are:

  * The process ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of file descriptors
  * The operating system ran out of memory

Your job may hang until the failure reason is fixed
(e.g., more file descriptors and/or memory becomes available), and may
eventually timeout / abort.

  Local host:     %s
  Errno:          %d (%s)
  Probable cause: %s
#
[too-many-conns]
PMIx has found multiple possible servers to which it could
connect. Further guidance is required to ensure the connection
is made to a desirable server. Guidance can be in the form
of the namespace or PID of a specific server, a directive to
connect to a system server, a specific URI to use, or the name
of a rendezvous file.

Some connection handles have been read from files named pmix.*
in subdirectories of $TMPDIR; delete them if they are stale.
#
[file-not-found]
There was an error when attempting to access the specified server
rendezvous file:

  Filename:  %s
  Error:     %s

Please correct the error and try again.
#
[mismatch-id]
The %s ID of the client process does not match the ID registered
by the host runtime:

  Process:     %u
  Registered:  %u

This could be a security issue. Please check the situation and
try again.
