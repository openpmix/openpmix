[fork-agent-not-found]
The specified fork agent was not found:

  Node:        %s
  Fork agent:  %s

The application cannot be launched.
#
[syscall fail]
A system call failed that should not have.  In this particular case,
a warning or error message was not displayed that should have been.
Your job may behave unpredictably after this, or abort.

  Local host:        %s
  Application name:  %s
  Function:          %s
  Location:          %s:%d
#
[execve error]
PMIx tried to fork a new process via the "execve" system call but
failed.  PMIx checks many things before attempting to launch a
child process, but nothing is perfect. This error may be indicative
of another problem on the target host, or even something as silly as
having specified a directory for your application.

  Local host:        %s
  Working dir:       %s
  Application name:  %s
  Error:             %s
#
[msg-too-large]
The error message being sent back to parent by new child is too
large:

  Msg size:   %lu
  Limit:      %lu

This is an unrecoverable error.
