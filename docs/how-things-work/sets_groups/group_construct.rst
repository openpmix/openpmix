Group Construction
==================

For purposes of constructing PMIx groups, PMIx defines two
classes of group members:

*leaders* have some global view of the group at time of
construction. This might consist of knowing the number of
leaders in the group, or knowing the process IDs of all
group leaders. All leaders must, of course, know the group
ID they are attempting to construct.

*members* know only that they are to participate in a given
group ID, but have no other knowledge of the group. For example,
a member may not know how many processes will be in the group
or any of their process IDs. The only requirement for membership
is that the process know the group ID to which they are to belong.

Within that context,
PMIx supports three methods for constructing PMIx groups. The
*collective* method is considered the more traditional form
of the operation but requires all group leaders to know the process ID
of all other leaders prior to calling the API.

In contrast,
the *bootstrap* method is a somewhat more dynamic form of the operation
that assumes each leader only knows the number of group leaders,
but does not know their process IDs. This is commonly the case when
two or mote collections of processes wish to join together (e.g., in an
MPI connect/accept operation), but only the "root" processes
know of each other. In such cases, each root process typically knows the
process ID of all processes in its collection, but only the root
process ID in the other collection(s).

In either of these two methods, additional group members can be
specified by any leader via the ``PMIX_GROUP_ADD_MEMBERS``
attribute. The PMIx server library and host are jointly responsible
for aggregating the
additional group members specified across leaders. Processes that are on the
"additional member" list must call ``PMIx_Group_construct``
with ``NULL`` in the  ``procs`` argument - this
indicates that the process is to
be added to the group when the group construct operation has completed.

Note that the group construct operation *cannot* complete until all
"leaders" and all add members" have
called ``PMIx_Group_construct``. This is required so that any group
and/or endpoint information
provided by the added members can be included in the returned
``pmix_info_t`` array.


Finally, the *invite* method represents the most dynamic form
of group construction as it is executed in an ad hoc manner that
revolves around a single leader that asynchronously invites
processes to join a group.

Each of these methods is explained further below. The PMIx library currently
conducts Continuous Integration (CI) tests for all three methods on each
pull request (PR) submitted to the library.


Collective Method
-----------------

All leaders know the ID of all other leaders, and thus call
``PMIx_Group_construct`` with the array of all leader process IDs.
Note that in this method, *all* leaders *must* call the API
with the array of process IDs. However, the array does not need
to be ordered - i.e., the order of IDs in the array does not need to
be the same across leaders.

An example of the collective method can be seen in the `group.c <https://github.com/openpmix/openpmix/blob/master/examples/group.c>`_ code from the PMIx library.

Library responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PMIx client library will collect all information posted by the client
on a ``PMIX_REMOTE`` scope and include it in the participation message
sent to its local server. Only "remote" data is included as all
local procs already have access to any "local" data that has been posted. The
message also includes any `pmix_info_t` values that were provided by
the caller, including any ``PMIX_GROUP_INFO`` contributions.

The local server will aggregate participation from clients operating
as leaders before
passing the request up to the host. If a timeout value was provided
by one or more clients, then the server must monitor the request for
timeout until it is passed up to the host. This is to protect against
the case where multiple local clients are participating, and one of
those clients fails to call the construct API (thus preventing the
server from passing the request to the host) within the specified
timeout. The server no longer has responsibility for detecting a
timeout condition once it determines the operation is locally complete
and has passed it to the host.

The local server will also immediately pass to the host a participation
request from a client operating as a "member" - i.e., a process that
is being included in the construct operation via an "add member"
specification. These participants are not counted against local completion
of the operation.

Upon notification of operation completion, the server will locally
store all information collected from the participants and then notify
each participating client (leaders as well as members). Notification
will include an array of the resulting membership IDs, plus any
assigned context ID and contributed group info.

Upon concluding the operation, each client shall have access to all
job-level information for namespaces that had a process participating
in the group, plus all information provided by the individual participants
(e.g., posted "remote" data).


Host responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The host is responsible for performing a collective allgather operation
across participants, returning all provided information to the involved
PMIx servers. This includes a complete membership list, including the
process ID of all leaders and added members. The host must ensure
that all "members" have participated prior to declaring the operation
to be complete.

Note that the group construct operation requires that each
participant have access to the job-level data of each namespace with
a participating process in the group. Some hosts (e.g., PRRTE) automatically
register each namespace with all PMIx servers, thus ensuring the job-level
information is always available. Other hosts may need to assemble and
register the participating namespaces separately.


Bootstrap Method
----------------
Bootstrap is used when the processes leading a group construct operation do
not know the identity of all other processes that will be participating, but at least
know how may leaders will be involved.
Leaders provide only their
own process ID in the ``procs`` parameter to the ``PMIx_Group_construct``
API, and are *required* to include the
``PMIX_GROUP_BOOTSTRAP`` attribute in their array of ``pmix_info_t``
directives, with the value in that attribute set to equal the number
of leaders in the group construct operation. They may also provide the
``PMIX_ADD_MEMBERS`` attribute with an array of process IDs that are to
belong to the final group - each of those processes will also call the group
construct, but with a ``NULL`` process ID to indicate they are joining
as "add members" and not leaders.

An example of the bootstrap method can be seen in `group_bootstrap.c <https://github.com/openpmix/openpmix/blob/master/examples/group_bootstrap.c>`_ from the PMIx library.


Library responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PMIx client library will collect all information posted by the client
on a ``PMIX_REMOTE`` scope and include it in the participation message
sent to its local server. Only "remote" data is included as all
local procs have access to any "local" data that has been posted. The
message also includes any `pmix_info_t` values that were provided by
the caller, including any ``PMIX_GROUP_INFO`` contributions.

Upon receiving the participation from a local client (whether "leader" or
"member"), the PMIx server will immediately pass the request up to the
host. The server bears no responsibility for aggregating the local
participants or for monitoring timeout conditions.

Upon notification of operation completion, the server will locally
store all information collected from the participants and then notify
each participating client (leaders as well as members). Notification
will include an array of the resulting membership IDs, plus any
assigned context ID and contributed group info.

Upon concluding the operation, each client shall have access to all
job-level information for namespaces that had a process participating
in the group, plus all information provided by the individual participants
(e.g., posted "remote" data).


Host responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The host is responsible for performing a collective allgather operation
across participants, returning all provided information to the involved
PMIx servers. This includes a complete membership list, including the
process ID of all leaders and added members. The host in this scenario
must look for and count participation by the specified number of leaders,
plus each individual member, before declaring the operation to be complete.

Note that the group construct operation requires that each
participant have access to the job-level data of each namespace with
a participating process in the group. Some hosts (e.g., PRRTE) automatically
register each namespace with all PMIx servers, thus ensuring the job-level
information is always available. Other hosts may need to assemble and
register the participating namespaces separately.


Invite Method
-------------

In contrast to the prior methods, the "invite" method does not involve
any collective operation. Instead, it relies solely on the event notification
subsystem (e.g., ``PMIx_Notify``) for its underlying execution.

Applications wishing to utilize this method must first register two
event handlers to receive (see the `asyncgroup.c <https://github.com/openpmix/openpmix/blob/master/examples/asyncgroup.c>`_ example from the PMIx library for details):

* the ``PMIX_GROUP_INVITED`` event. This will be triggered in
  a process when someone calls ``PMIx_Group_invite`` and includes that
  process in the array of desired members. The handler must retrieve the
  specified ``PMIX_GROUP_ID`` from the provided array of attributes, and
  then call ``PMIx_Group_join_nb`` to indicate the desired response (e.g., a
  value of ``PMIX_GROUP_ACCEPT`` to join the group).

  .. note:: The handler *cannot* call the blocking form of the "group join"
            API as it is invoked from inside the PMIx library's progress
            thread. Doing so will cause a thread deadlock condition.

* the ``PMIX_GROUP_COMPLETE`` event, which will be triggered once the
  construct operation has completed. This can be used to receive the final
  group membership, along with any provided group info or other data.

The construct procedure is initiated by a single "leader" that calls the
``PMIx_Group_Invite`` API, providing (among other optional things) an array
of process IDs that it wishes to have join the group. Prior to doing so,
the leader may choose to register an event handler for the ``PMIX_GROUP_INVITE_FAILED``
event. This will allow the library to notify the process should any of
the specified prospective members reject the invitation, or terminate
prior to responding to it. Upon receiving a "failed" event, the leader
can optionally replace the rejecting process with another, can terminate
the group construct operation, or can ignore the failure (thereby accepting
a reduced final group membership).

The leader will return from the ``PMIx_Group_invite`` function once all
specified members have responded to the invitation. In addition, the leader
will (since it is a member of the group) receive the ``PMIX_GROUP_COMPLETE``
event specifying the status return of the operation (``PMIX_SUCCESS`` to
indicate that the group successfully constructed, or else an appropriate
error value) and, if successful, containing the resulting information.


Library responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PMIx client library is solely responsible for executing the underlying
handshakes to support this method of group construction. The library will
collect all information posted by each participant
on a ``PMIX_REMOTE`` scope and include it in the invitation event (if
the process is the leader) or in the "join" event (if a participating
member). Only "remote" data is included as all
local procs have access to any "local" data that has been posted. The
event also includes any `pmix_info_t` values that were provided by
the caller, including any ``PMIX_GROUP_INFO`` contributions.

The client library tracks all contributions and assembles the final
"complete" event payload, which includes a complete membership array
plus all provided information.  In this case, the provided information
(e.g., that posted by each participant) will *not* be stored on the
server, but instead delivered to each individual participant's data
store for subsequent retrieval via `PMIx_Get`.

The PMIx server library's sole responsibility is transferring the
events generated by its local clients to/from the host.


Host responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The host is responsible solely for propagating event notifications across
participating processes.
