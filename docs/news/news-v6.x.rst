PMIx v6.x series
================

This file contains all the NEWS updates for the PMIx v6.x
series, in reverse chronological order.

6.0.0 -- TBD
------------
.. important:: This is the first release in the v6 family. The intent
               for this series is to provide regular "reference tags",
               effectively serving as milestones for any development
               that might occur after the project achieved a stable
               landing zone at the conclusion of the v5 series. It
               is expected, therefore, that releases shall be infrequent
               and rare occurrences, primarily driven by the completion
               of some significant feature or some particularly
               critical bug fix.

               For this initial release, that feature is completion of
               the Group family of APIs. This includes support for all
               three of the group construction modes, including the new
               "bootstrap" method. A description of each mode can be
               found in the :ref:`Group Construction <group-construction-label>`
               section of the documentation.

A full list of individual changes will not be provided here,
but will commence with the v6.0.1 release.
