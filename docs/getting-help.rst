Getting help
============

Found a bug?  Got a question?  Want to make a suggestion?  Want to
contribute to OpenPMIx?  Please let us know!

Many common questions about building and using OpenPMIx are answered
on the `OpenPMIx FAQ <https://openpmix.org/support/faq/>`_.

   I suggest taking all the content from the FAQ and folding it into
   these docs.

If the FAQ isn't enough, questions and comments should generally be
posted to the `OpenPMIx GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/openpmix/openpmix/issues>`_.

Alternatively, questions can also be sent to the `OpenPMIx mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pmix>`_
(pmix@googlegroups.com).  Because of spam, only subscribers are
allowed to post to this list (ensure that you subscribe with and post
from *exactly* the same e-mail address -- joe@example.com is
considered different than joe@mycomputer.example.com!).

When submitting questions and problems, be sure to include as much
extra information as possible.  `This web page
<https://openpmix.org/support/>`_ details all the information that we
request in order to provide assistance.
